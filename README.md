## 🏗️ Architecture & Technical Highlights

<h1>Design System</h1>

* **Luxury Visual Hierarchy**: Implemented a sophisticated 60-30-10 palette using **#1A1A1A (Deep Charcoal)**, **#F5E6CC (Cream)**, and **#D48C45 (Burnt Gold)**.
* **Adaptive Content Strategy**: Engineered a mobile-first responsive layout that preserves the "Michelin Star" aesthetic across all device breakpoints.
* **Performance-Driven Motion**: Utilized hardware-accelerated CSS transitions and hover-state logic to simulate the fluidity of a high-end physical menu.

<h2>Core Components</h2>

* **Intelligent Nested Routing**: Leveraged Next.js 15+ App Router for scoped loading states and persistent navigation.
* **Dynamic State Management**: An interactive "Hearth Collection" menu using React State to handle real-time image and description swapping.
* **Custom Skeleton UI**: Hand-crafted loading states (`loading.tsx`) designed to maintain visual stability and improve perceived performance during data streaming.
* **Atmospheric Reservations**: A psychologically optimized booking form using custom input styling to mirror a physical leather-bound guest book.
